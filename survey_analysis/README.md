# Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are a great way to work with data using popular
scripting languages. For years Jupyter notebooks were called IPython
notebooks but the good folks who created the IPython interpreter got
a bucket of cash and decided to create a language agnostic notebook.
This became project [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) -- a rough acronym
that pays homage to many of the more popular open-source scientific
scripting langauages: **Ju**lia + **py**thon + te**r**.

For this project we will start with the `datascience-notebook`
maintained by the jupyter team as part of the [docker-stacks](
https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks) project.
